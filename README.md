#  Apple Products Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **Apple product sales data** to uncover key insights related to product performance, regional sales distribution, and revenue patterns.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I conducted an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand how different Apple products contribute to overall sales and profitability.
The analysis provides a clear picture of Apple’s market trends, best-selling products, and potential areas for growth — a great example of how data analytics can inform business strategy.

## 🧭 Project Motivation
Apple is one of the world’s leading tech companies with a diverse range of products including iPhones, MacBooks, iPads, and accessories.  
The aim of this project was to:
- Understand **which products contribute most** to total sales and revenue.
- Explore **sales patterns across time and regions**.
- Use **data-driven insights** to identify potential business opportunities.

By performing this analysis, I learned how to handle real-world datasets, clean messy data, and use visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

## 📊 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
- The dataset used contains sales information such as:
  - Product name and category  
  - Quantity sold  
  - Unit price  
  - Total sales/revenue  
  - Country or region of sale  
  - Date of transaction  

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset Source: [Apple Products Sales Data - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amangarg08/apple-retail-sales-dataset)

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Performed essential data preparation steps:
- Removed missing or null values  
- Converted incorrect data types (e.g., price and date columns)  
- Handled duplicate records  
- Created new columns such as `Total_Revenue = Quantity * Price`  
- Standardized categorical values for consistency  

### **3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key exploratory steps and findings include:
- **Descriptive statistics** to understand data distribution  
- **Correlation analysis** between product price, sales quantity, and total revenue  
- **Category-wise and region-wise breakdowns** to find the top-performing segments  
- **Trend analysis** over time to see peak sales months or quarters  

### **4️⃣ Data Visualization**
Created multiple visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- 📈 Line plots for monthly sales trends  
- 🧭 Bar charts for top-selling Apple products  
- 🌍 Heatmaps for regional sales comparison  
- 🧩 Pair plots to visualize relationships among numerical variables  
- 🎯 Pie charts showing category-wise revenue contribution  

These visualizations helped transform raw data into **actionable business insights**.
